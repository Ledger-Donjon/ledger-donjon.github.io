04 August 2020: Path derivation too permissive in Bitcoin derivative apps


## Summary

The Ledger Nano S and Nano X are [Hierarchical Deterministic](#4) (HD) wallets,
meaning that they can derive different cryptographic secrets from a single seed.
As written in the [Threat Model](#1), apps can derive keys on their own HD path
only, which ensures that cryptocurrency apps cannot use keys from each other.
For instance, the Zcoin app cannot derive keys on the Dogecoin derivation path
(`m/44'/3'/`), since its own derivation path is `m/44'/128'/`.

This path restriction was not enforced for the Bitcoin app and most of its
derivatives, allowing a Bitcoin derivative (eg. Litecoin) to derive public keys
or sign Bitcoin transactions.


## Technical Analysis

When installing an app on the Ledger Nano S/X, a list of allowed paths
is provided. In the source code, it is usually specified in the `Makefile` of
the app. For instance, the [Monero app](#2) is allowed to use the path
`m/44'/128'` (`2147483692/2147483776`) thanks to the `--path` parameter:

```
APP_LOAD_PARAMS= --path "2147483692/2147483776" --curve secp256k1 $(COMMON_LOAD_PARAMS) --appFlags 0x240
APPNAME = "Monero"
```

This parameter is enforced by the OS when any app retrieves a key used for
public key derivation and transaction signature (using syscall
`os_perso_derive_node_bip32`).


This parameter is however [empty](#3) in the Bitcoin app and in its derivatives
(at the exception of Qtum). The following table presents the coins affected by
this lack of restriction:

Enforcing the restriction to one or multiple paths for each coin type is
actually a tough topic because:

- Some third party software wallets use incorrect derivation paths. This is a
  specific concern for older coins using third party wallets based on Electrum
  (Dogecoin, Litecoin, Dash, etc.)
- Some BTC forks use the same derivation path as BTC. If we prevent these
  forks from using the BTC derivation path, this would  simply prevent users from
  using the Ledger Nano S/X with these forks.

For completeness, the following paths are standard for all Bitcoin variants:

- BIP 44 (`44'/type'`)
- BIP 49 if supporting Segwit (`49'/type'`)
- BIP 84 if supporting Native Segwit (`84'/type'`)

We can assume that by default all coins support those 3 paths for their type.
Bitcoin being in use for some time, additional non standard paths have popped
up:

- BIP 45 (`45'/type'`) for Copay multisignatures
- "GA'/" (`18941'/`) - GreenAddress proprietary for the shared multisignature address
- Users can also sign on randomly selected paths with PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction from BIP 174)


## Remediation

We had to make a choice between security and usability, wanting to avoid a
situation where user funds would be locked and users unable to spend their funds
anymore. We thus chose to enforce a path lock in the Bitcoin app itself. If a
Bitcoin derivative app tries to perform a derivation on an unusual path, a
warning is displayed to the user.

In order to allow users to continue to use their Ledger Nano S/X seamlessly with any
third party software wallet, this fix doesn't enforce this verification from the
OS though, which means that the `--path` parameter is still empty. We might add
an exhaustive path list in the future if we are sure it doesn't break any other
wallets.

This security bulletin will be updated once a new version of the Bitcoin app is
available.
