27 December 2018: MCU Bootloader verification bypass.



## Summary

The signature verification of the Ledger Nano S MCU can be bypassed, allowing an
attacker to install an arbitrary firmware on the MCU.



## Technical details

The vulnerability was publicly disclosed during the [35C3](#1) [event](#2). The
[video](#4) from LiveOverflow explains the technical details of this
vulnerabilty.

An arbitrary firmware can be installed on the MCU without physical access, while
it should be prevented by a signature verification mechanism.



## Impact on the Ledger Nano S

A [blogpost](#3) was already written in response to the presentation.

After a thorough review, we consider that the vulnerability has no security
consequence:

- The vulnerability doesn't allow anything more than what the JTAG already
  allows.
- The Secure Element ensures that the firmware running on the MCU is genuine and
  there isn't enough space available (even after compression) to bypass the
  Secure Element check and embed a malicious payload.
- The MCU manages the screen but doesn't have any access to the PIN nor the seed,
  which are stored on the Secure Element.



## Credits

Dmitry Nedospasov, Josh Datko and Thomas Roth discovered the vulnerability.
