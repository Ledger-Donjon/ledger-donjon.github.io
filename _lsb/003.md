20 March 2018: Isolation vulnerability.



## Summary

A malicious app can break the isolation between apps and access sensitive data
managed by specific apps such as GPG, U2F or Neo.



## Technical details

A [blogpost](#1) is already written and explains the technical details of this
vulnerability. Sergei Volokitin also gave a talk ([whitepaper](#2),
[slides](#3)) at Black Hat USA 2018.


### Architecture

In order to understand all the work performed by Sergei, it's important to have
an overview of BOLOS architecture.

BOLOS (Ledger's OS) is a native and versatile OS which can be implemented on
several hardware architectures. It uses most of the security features brought by
the Secure Element (Nano S case).

![architecture](https://www.ledger.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/graph-2-V2@2x-300x181.png)

The OS lies on the secure hardware and uses the certified security functions
implemented in the hardware.

It offers cryptographic primitives which allows applications to compute
electronic signatures for instance. To compute an electronic signature the app
performs a syscall to BOLOS which takes advantage of the secure hardware to
compute securely the digital signature. Furthermore the OS contains certificate
allowing to update itself securely. This certificate allows to authenticate the
device preventing Ledger devices from being cloned.

It also contains a service which authenticates the applications loaded on top of
it. It's possible to load signed app and unsigned app as well. In this last case
a warning is displayed on the screen when launched.

Finally, the OS provides memory isolation. It means for instance that BTC app
can not access to the data of the ETH app. This mechanism is enforced using the
MPU of the Secure Element.

However, when an app is installed it can derive any key path. So even if the
memory isolation is implemented, It's possible to load an app which can access
the private keys of any cryptocurrency. The derived paths during the install can
be checked looking at the loading files.

As it's a bit technical, Ledger strongly recommend to load only signed (by
Ledger) app which only derives their own path.


### Bypassing the isolation

The security researcher found a bug in our isolation implementation. In several
syscalls offered by BOLOS, the pointers the parameters were not correctly
checked allowing to reference NULL pointer, or to give pointers located in other
regions of the memories. Additionally, in some conditions, the MPU bounds were
incorrectly positioned allowing a malicious app to use these syscalls in order
to access data outside of its scope.

#### NULL Pointer dereferencing

The researcher built an oracle allowing to use the Hash primitive to dump part
of memory. The idea is to call `cx_hash_sha256` with a null pointer varying the
length of data to be hashed. The data at offset `0x00` is then hashed by the
`cx_hash_sha256` service and the result of the hash is returned.

Secure hash are one-way function but requesting a hash of length 1, allows the
attacker to try all possible value for the byte and check which one gives the
returned hash. The same process is applied with length 2 knowing the first byte
and so on.

- Consequences: it allowed the researcher to dump a large amount of data. The
  seed and private keys are stored in memory zones that cannot be dumped using
  this vulnerability.

#### Pointers length not properly checked

The length of some syscalls (`cx_hash_syscall`, `cx_rsa_sign`, `cx_ecdsa_sign`)
was not sufficiently checked. Using a malicious applet, it's possible to use
these syscalls to retrieve partial information. Indeed, depending on the value
of the `RSA_key` or of the hash structure header, the crypto service returns a
different error.

The attack scenario is the following:

- Load a malicious app which requests one of these crypto service
- The crypto service is called with an incorrect length parameters
- Depending on the value of the pointed memory, a different exception is raised

Consequences: It allows to distinguish some specific value in the memory. In the
RSA case, it's possible to know if a specific 32-bit value at a given memory
address equals one of these values `0x80000000`, `0x00010000`, `0x80010000`,
`0x00020000`, or not.

The researcher thought these values were from the RSA key while they belong to
the next app.

In the hash case, it's possible to know if a specific 8-bit value at a given
memory address is comprised between 1 and 8.

In the `ecdsa_sign` function, it's possible to retrieve 64 bytes of the memory
of the following application. In this case the implemented mechanism is even
trickier and won't be detailed here.

In these 3 cases, this is partial information dump but leads at least to an
entropy reduction and is thus considered as an attack. Again the seed and
private keys remained secure.

#### Device wipe

After 3 PIN resets, the device wipes the OS data memory, erasing the seed and
the private keys which are stored in the OS data memory. But the device does not
wipe the apps data. The researcher showed it's possible to retrieve the data in
a previously installed app. The scenario is the following:

- Get a device
- Perform 3 wrong PINs to trigger a wipe
- Install a specific (unsigned) app with a large uninitialized data zone and a
  command allowing to dump this zone

Consequences: this allowed the researcher to dump memory of already installed
app breaking thus the isolation. In our signed applications, secret data are not
stored in their flash zone. Only the following applications could have been
revealed application data information:

- Neo (a third party app).
- PGP (a developer app). It allows the user to import its private key which is
  clearly not protected by the seed.
- Monero Beta: this app is only a beta app since it's released yet. Monero
  offers different way to handle the key. At the beginning there was no BIP
  derivation.
- U2F: on this app, the researcher proved it was possible to retrieve the HMAC
  Key and the current value of the counter of the U2F app.


### Countermeasure

- The length parameters are now properly checked and the MPU windows correctly
  positioned.
- The flash user zone is also wiped after 3 wrong PINs. This wipe is checked at
  startup. The new design is completely tearing proof.



## Impact on Ledger devices

A malicious app has to be installed on the Ledger device in order to exploit the
vulnerabilities.

If no unsigned application was installed (requiring the use of command-line
tools and ignoring a security warning on the device); the data managed by
specific apps such as GPG, U2F or Neo is perfectly safe.

Upgrading the firmware fully mitigates the attacks. Firmware from version 1.4
are not vulnerable.

We would like to thank the security researcher Sergei Volokitin who discovered
the vulnerability and reported it through our bug bounty program. We also thank
him for his good work, his help and his professionalism through the disclosure
process.
