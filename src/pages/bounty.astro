        Ledger believes in better security through openness. We welcome and value technical reports 
        of vulnerabilities that could substantially affect the confidentiality or integrity of user 
        data on Ledger devices or the security of our infrastructure.
      </p>
      
      <div class="contact-box">
        <p>
          If you believe that you have discovered such a vulnerability, please report it at 
          <strong>bounty -at- ledger.fr</strong>

        </p>
        <p>
          The Ledger Security Team will work with you to investigate, resolve the issue promptly 
          and reward the first reporter of a vulnerability.

            <h3>Devices Bug Bounty</h3>
            <p>We are mainly interested in vulnerabilities that would eventually allow attackers to steal crypto assets from Ledger devices.</p>
            
            <h4>Scopes</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Hardware attacks on the Ledger devices (i.e. hardware products)</li>
              <li>Software attacks on the firmware running on the devices</li>
              <li>Vulnerabilities in apps available through Ledger Live</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>In-Scope Vulnerabilities</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Bypass of the PIN</li>
              <li>Arbitrary code execution on the SE</li>
              <li>Arbitrary code execution on the MCU (without physical access)</li>
              <li>Privilege escalation from an app</li>
              <li>Bypass of user confirmation to issue a transaction</li>
              <li>Sensitive memory leak</li>

            <h3>Web Bug Bounty</h3>
            <p>We are interested in critical vulnerabilities in our infrastructure. In a nutshell, we are interested in real vulnerabilities, not in output of automated scanners.</p>
            
            <h4>Out-of-scope Vulnerabilities</h4>
            <ul class="out-of-scope">
              <li>Presence/absence of SPF/DMARC records</li>
              <li>Lack of CSRF tokens</li>
              <li>Clickjacking and tabnagging issues</li>
              <li>Missing security headers which do not lead directly to a vulnerability</li>
              <li>Missing best practices (we require evidence of a security vulnerability)</li>
              <li>Reports from automated tools or scans</li>
              <li>Reports of insecure SSL/TLS ciphers (unless you have a working proof of concept)</li>
              <li>Absence of rate limiting</li>
              <li>Editable Github wikis</li>
              <li>Outdated software without any noteworthy vulnerability</li>
              <li>Broken links</li>

            <h3>Phishing Attempt Bounty</h3>
            <p>We are also interested in any information allowing us to protect our users from attacks (Phishing, Smishing, Vishing, etc).</p>
            <p>We have created a <strong>10 BTC fund</strong> for any information leading to successful arrest and prosecution.</p>
            <p>To submit your bounty information, please use <strong>bounty-phishing - at - ledger.com</strong>.</p>
            <p class="note">Payment will require meeting KYC requirements.</p>

        <h2>Responsible Disclosure Policy</h2>
        
        <p>
          At Ledger, we believe that Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure is the right approach to 
          better protect users. When submitting a vulnerability report, you enter a form of cooperation 
          in which you allow Ledger the opportunity to diagnose and remedy the vulnerability before 
          disclosing its details to third parties and/or the general public.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In return, Ledger commits that security researchers reporting bugs will be protected from 
          legal liability, so long as they follow responsible disclosure guidelines and principles.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Do not engage in testing that degrades Ledger's information systems and products</li>
          <li>Do not access, store, share or destroy Ledger or user data</li>
          <li>Do not impact Ledger users, such as denial of service, social engineering or spam</li>
          <li>Do not exploit vulnerabilities on our infrastructure — the Bounty Program is about improving security, not deliberately putting the community at risk</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Submission Process</h2>
        
        <p>
          Submission reports should include a detailed description of your discovery with clear, 
          concise steps allowing us to reproduce the issue, or a working proof-of-concept.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Low quality reports, such as those that include inadequate information to investigate, 
          may incur significant delays in the disclosure process. Please only submit one report per issue.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          All communications between you and Ledger should go through <strong>bounty -at- ledger.fr</strong>. 
          Please use our <a href="/ledger-bounty.asc">GPG key</a> as necessary.
        </p>
        
        <p>The Ledger Security Team will be in touch, usually within 24 hours.</p>
        
        <h2>Remediation & Disclosure</h2>
        
        <p>
          After triage, we will send a quick acknowledgement and commit to being as transparent 
          as possible about the remediation timeline as well as on issues or challenges that may extend it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Ledger has a <strong>90-day disclosure policy</strong>, which means that we do our best to 
          fix issues within 90 days upon receipt of a vulnerability report.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Reward</h2>
        
        <p>You may be eligible to receive a reward if:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>You are the first person to submit a given vulnerability</li>
          <li>That vulnerability is determined to be a valid security issue by the Ledger Security Team</li>
          <li>You have complied with the Ledger Bug Bounty program policy and guidelines</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          The decision to grant a reward for the discovery of a valid security issue is at Ledger's 
          sole discretion. The amount of each bounty is based on the classification and sensitivity 
          of the data impacted, the completeness of your Submission report, ease of exploit and 
          overall risk for Ledger's users and brand.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Bounties will be paid directly to the researcher using Bitcoin.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>Eligibility Requirements</h3>
        
        <p>To be eligible for a reward, you must not:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Be a resident of, or make your vulnerability submission from, a country against which France has issued export sanctions or other trade restrictions</li>
          <li>Be in violation of any national, state, or local law or regulation</li>
          <li>Be employed by Ledger or its subsidiaries or affiliates</li>
          <li>Be an immediate family member of a person employed by Ledger or its subsidiaries or affiliates</li>
          <li>Be less than 18 years of age (if under 18, you must get your parents' or legal guardian's permission)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Hall of Fame</h2>
        
        <p>
          In mutual consultation, we can, if you desire, display a researcher's name or its pseudonym 
          as the discoverer of the reported vulnerability on our website's 
          <a href="/hall-of-fame/">Hall of Fame</a>. Please note that the Hall of Fame is dedicated 
          to the Devices Bug Bounty Program.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Be kind</li>
          <li>Be respectful and professional in your communications and behavior</li>
          <li>Hate speech, profanity, or any aggressive threats will not be tolerated</li>
